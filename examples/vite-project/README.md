# General example

## Usage

The exported binaries are available here for npm scripts (see `package.json`â†’`scripts`).

They can also be ran by `npx bump` or `npx greet`.

## Troubleshoot

1. Make sure to run `pnpm run build` in the project root, without this, the project is not built and installed in this example.

2. Make sure to change directory to this example when running the above usage commands.
